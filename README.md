This is the 11th project in The Open Source Factory, in which I will merge the API's from the three services that I use to listen to music: Youtube, Spotify and Soundcloud. The idea is to create a board similar of the one that a DJ has and be able to play and mix music in it from these different platforms.

The idea is to have authentication, because there will be a place where authenticated people will share their music and with that be able to connect with each other. I want to have a functionality similar to the desk of a dj on which I can play two pieces of music from different platforms and be able to play with each other as a DJ would. What I have in my mind now is that this place will be something like a layer on top of DJ's.

Challenges:

- Add authentication and a user page / dashboard on which each person will have its information.
- Add a music player that is independent from which platform the music is coming from (sourced from the different platforms).
- Connect with the API's of these three services, and be able to bring from there the pieces that the particular user has found valuable.
- Study the API's of the three services and establish between them similarities and differences that speak about what is behind each project.
- Establish what is valuable from each of the services, and be able to work with that.
